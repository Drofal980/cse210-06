CUTS (until we catch up)
=====
-no rotating
-only one piece
-one color

make grid an actor
with functions grid_activate and grid_deactivate
activate displays based on matrix
grid_deactivate erases on screen

with activated values, have that create and display brick

PLAN FOR SHAPES

Create a class for each type of brick
within each, set initial brick = 0
each time to rotate, add or subtract location of other bricks relative to first brick
